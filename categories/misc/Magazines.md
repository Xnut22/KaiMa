One of the best ways to get an insight into the games industry is to look at the magazines that were available at the time, both game specific magazines and digital/creative magazines have a wealth of information.

# Games Industry Magazines
Occasionally you can be lucky enough to find a whole magazine specifically dedicated to Game Development but they can be few and far between. Unfortunetly most are now defunct but one excellent title remains until the time of writing: Wireframe magazine, if you are in a position to support this magazine I would strongly reccomend it.

Title | Publisher | Notes
---|---|---
Develop | NewBayMedia | Published from August 1996 Until November 2017
Game Developer | UBM Tech | March 1994 until July 2013
Game Maker | Future Publishing | Only 1 issue published?
Wireframe | Raspberry Pi Press | From November 2018 and still going strong in January 2022!

## Wireframe Magazine
[Issues — Wireframe Magazine](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.com/issues)

### Articles
It is worth reading the entire Wrireframe issues cover-to-cover but here is a table of the articles most relevant to game development:

Issue | Name
---|---
1 | City Craft - The design Theory behind video game cities
1 | Source Code - How particle physics turned Defender into a coin-op classic
1 | Maths of balance - Examining the curves and formulae behind the games we play

---
# Games Specific Magazines
There are many magazines related to Gaming both past and present, however only a few of them have interesting articles about game development, the ones we know about are listed in the table below.

Title | Notes

PC Gamer | long Running UK Magazine dedicated to PC Gaming, sometimes has game developer and modding content
PSi2 | Published by Thin ice media (Datel) this occasionally contains top quality articles about Homebrew and Game Development for the Playstation 2

---
## PSi2 Magazine
Published by Thin-Ice Media (Owned by Datel) it was the only non-official Playstation 2 magazine to include a playable CD every issue. 
Each CD would contain a few Action Replay Cheats and save games that can be applied to a few select games, it formed as a good advertisement to Datel's Action Replay product.

### PSi2 Magazine CDs
Some of the Magazine CDs/DVDs contained Video content on behind the scenes information for upcoming games, such as interviews with developers.

Issue Number | Content

21 | Trailers for Auto Modellista, Red Dread Revolver, Dino Stalker, JoJo's Bizare Adventure and others

29 | The Making of Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness

# Creative Magazines
Creative Magazines related to topics such as art/3d graphics and even web development are just as valuable a source as gaming magazines for the time as they would often talk about industry events and software that were often used by game developers.

Title | Notes

## Computer Graphics World (USA)
Computer Graphics World (CGW) is one of the longest running magazines dedicated to computer graphics, published initially in the late 70s right up to the present day (2022+).

One of the good things about CGW is that they have articles from each issue available on their web page, going all the way back to 1999. Howevr one of the bad things is that they seem to actively take down PDFs of pre-1999 issues from sites such as Archive.org. This really is a shame as they are one of the best resources to see the state of the art in 3D graphics at a particular point in time.

Since this website is dedicated to real-time applications of computer graphics the most useful years are from the 90s onwards when colourful 2D and 3D graphics become possible on consumer hardware.

The magazine is formed of 80+ pages of content, some of which are adverts (interesting CG tool adverts however!) and the following main content sections:
* Editor's Note (Also on Website)
* Letters - Published user letters sent to the magazine (Only in physical Magazine)
* Spotlight - News and Products (Also on Website)
* Tech Watch - Interesting artcles (Only in physical Magazine)
* Portfolio (Not got copyright permission for website)
* User Focus
* Products (Also on Website)

### Book Extracts
The accompaning CD for Computer Arts often had extracts from popular industy books in PDF format, this was a great way to both advertise the book in question and supply useful content for artists. Much of these are extracts from books that game artists would almost certainly have in their collection.

### Free Resources
Often the CDs would contain free resources from around the Web, such as a few sample hours of Video training courses or templates/images. One awesome thing they started doing was including full PDFs for issues from 2 years prior but sadly this didn't last very long.

### Free Full products
Occassionally as an incentive to buy the magazine there would be a few paid products that are offered "free" as long as you have bought the magazine. Not all issues included free full products but the ones that did were generally worth picking up, but of course it was always an older version of the products as an incentive to upgrade to the latest versions.

Issue | Free Product | Notes

## Web Designer Magazine (UK)
Web Designer Magazine was a popular UK magazine purely dedicated to Web development, it was a relaunch of a previous magazine called **Practical Internet** and was known by the lengthy title **Practical Internet Web Designer** from issue 86 until dropping the prefix altogether by issue 95 in 2004.

It was initially published by **Highbury House** until they went into receivership on January 20th 2006 where it was bought by Imagine Publishing, which eventually it was sold to Future Publishing and then discontinued at issue 293 [confirmation required].

### Total Web Design
Strangely for a magazine dedicated to Web Development, there was no website for the magazine or even its sister title “Practical Web Projects”. This changed in mid 2004 when bought 

Issue number 97 from August 2004 had a behind the scenes look at the creation of the website, Luckily the Wayback machine has an archive of the website: 
[Total Web Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20040730202310/http://www.total-web-design.com/) 

### Editors
It was edited by Thomas Watson from the rename of Practical Internet in 2003 until issue 101 where it was taken over by Mark Hattersley in issue 104. Issue 102-103 did not have an editor and was simply signed off by “The Web Designer Team”.

### Issues
Each issue had a main focus but they all contained tutorials for a wide variety of software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, PHP and Flash.

The issues we know about are listed in the table below:

Number | Date | Title
